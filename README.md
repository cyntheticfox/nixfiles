A complete NixOS configuration, tailored to how I do things. Set up with some secrets via [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix), and splitting out user configuration into a home-manager configuration. Also provides a few packages and an overlay, as inspired by [FoosterOS/2 Warp](https://github.com/lilyinstarlight/foosteros).
